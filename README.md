# MODULE 1. FINAL PROJECT

This project has been created to implement all the concepts that we have been learning in the first module of the course.

## Content

The content was made following all the requirements given by the teachers and it was built using the
[Adalab web starter kit](https://github.com/Adalab/adalab-web-starter-kit)

To implement this package into my project, the first thing I did was to download the starter kit, set it up and start editing the files in the src directory.
To install the dependencies I had to use the comands `npm install` and `npm start` in the terminal zsh. After that I started to build the project's parts which were divided in partials, and were conected to its respective HTML parts using the `<include>` tag generated by the starter kit.
The project has tree main parts which are Header where `flexbox` layout was used, Main which contains 2 sections where the second one was mocked-up with `grid`, and a Footer which was also laid out using `flexbox`.
For the styles given to the project, SASS was used to condense the code and together with BEM for a correct use of classes given to the HTML tags. All of it was compiled into CSS.
